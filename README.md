### **Project Report: Date Class Implementation**

#### **Objective:**
The projectâ€™s objective was to design and implement a `MyDate` class in Java that represents dates and provides various operations such as:
1. Validating the date.
2. Updating a date.
3. Calculating the difference between two dates.
4. Getting the day of the week for a given date.
5. Sorting a list of dates in ascending order.
6. Displaying dates in a formatted manner.

This project also includes a `Main` class that demonstrates the functionality of the `MyDate` class.

### **Design Choices:**

1. **Date Representation:**
   - The `MyDate` class has three main attributes: `dayOfMonth`, `monthOfYear`, and `yearOfDate`, representing the day, month, and year of the date, respectively.
   - The class provides a constructor that takes in three parameters for initializing these attributes.
   - If the provided date is invalid (e.g., February 30th), the constructor sets the date to `January 1, 1970`, which is commonly used as a default "epoch" date.

2. **Validation (`isDateValid()` method):**
   - The date is validated against several rules:
     - The year should be greater than or equal to 1.
     - The month should be between 1 and 12.
     - The day should be within the allowed number of days for the given month, considering leap years for February.
   - Leap years are checked using the rule:
     - A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, but not divisible by 100 unless it is also divisible by 400.

3. **Date Update (`updateDate()` method):**
   - The `updateDate()` method allows updating the day, month, and year attributes.
   - It ensures that the updated date is valid, and if not, it prints an error message.

4. **Day of the Week (`getDayOfWeek()` method):**
   - The `getDayOfWeek()` method uses the `GregorianCalendar` class to calculate the day of the week. The method returns a string representation of the day (e.g., "Monday").

5. **Date Difference (`calculateDaysDifference()` method):**
   - The `calculateDaysDifference()` method calculates the difference in days between two `MyDate` objects.
   - It does so by converting both dates to milliseconds and then calculating the absolute difference.

6. **Sorting (`compareTo()` method):**
   - The class implements `Comparable<MyDate>`, enabling the sorting of a list of `MyDate` objects.
   - The comparison is done first by year, then by month, and finally by day.

7. **Formatted Date Printing (`printFormattedDate()` method):**
   - The `printFormattedDate()` method prints the date in a user-friendly format like "January 1, 2023."

### **Algorithms and Data Structures Used:**

- **`Comparable<MyDate>` Interface:**
  - The `MyDate` class implements `Comparable<MyDate>`, which allows comparing two `MyDate` objects based on the year, month, and day. This is necessary for sorting the `MyDate` objects in ascending order.

- **`GregorianCalendar` Class:**
  - The `GregorianCalendar` class from the `java.util` package was used to handle date manipulation and calculation of the day of the week. This class provides an easy way to work with dates and handle leap years.

- **`ArrayList` and `Collections.sort()`:**
  - An `ArrayList<MyDate>` is used to store multiple `MyDate` objects. The `Collections.sort()` method is used to sort the list of dates. The `compareTo()` method, defined in the `MyDate` class, is invoked during sorting.

- **Date Validation Algorithm:**
  - The date validation uses a series of conditional checks to ensure the date is valid, including checking for valid month numbers and considering the number of days in each month, including leap year rules for February.

### **Challenges Encountered:**

1. **Leap Year Calculation:**
   - Ensuring the correct calculation of leap years was a key challenge. While most date validation algorithms account for this, correctly handling century years (divisible by 100 but not by 400) required careful attention.
   
2. **Date Comparison and Sorting:**
   - Comparing dates and sorting them in the correct order by year, month, and day required implementing the `Comparable<MyDate>` interface correctly. Special care was taken to handle edge cases where two dates fall within the same year or month.

3. **Handling Invalid Dates:**
   - Properly handling invalid dates (e.g., February 30th or April 31st) and ensuring the date object fell back to a default valid date (January 1, 1970) was a challenge. The code avoids crashes by gracefully handling invalid input.

---

### **Improvements Made to the Initial Implementation:**

- **Date Validation:**
  - Initially, there were issues with invalid dates not being properly handled, especially for months with fewer than 31 days. These were corrected by adding logic for validating the number of days in each month and handling leap years.

- **User-Friendly Output:**
  - The formatted output for the date was improved by providing a more readable format ("Month day, year") for better user experience.

- **Error Handling:**
  - The `updateDate()` method was improved to print an error message if the new date is invalid, ensuring the user receives feedback.

---

### **Conclusion:**
This implementation of the `MyDate` class provides a flexible, reusable solution for handling dates in Java. The key features include validation of dates, calculation of the difference between dates, retrieving the day of the week, and sorting a list of dates. The code was designed to handle edge cases and provide meaningful error messages when invalid dates are encountered. The use of `Comparable` and `GregorianCalendar` ensures correct behavior in all scenarios.

Future improvements could involve adding file input/output capabilities, allowing users to input dates from a file and output results to a file. Additionally, more sophisticated date handling, such as supporting time zones or including time of day, could be implemented.
